# T-SJTTR
* The T-SJTTR model aims to extract representative TSC(time sync comment,also called buletscreen)from every time slice of video.
* The original paper as follow:[**L Xu,C Zhang.,Bridging Video Content and Comments: Synchronized Video Description with Temporal Summarization of Crowdsourced Time-Sync Comments.**](http://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI17/paper/download/14717/13958)
* The formual [11] in the paper is wrong.The correct formula should be as follow:

* This model spend less time and is better than other model which extract the useful information from TSC.
